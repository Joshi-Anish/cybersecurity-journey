# Networking Concepts

Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity. Understanding how devices communicate over networks is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and securing systems. This guide covers the core concepts.

## 1. Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Connects devices within a small area, e.g., home or office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Connects devices over large distances, e.g., the Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a city or large campus.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Very small network for personal devices, e.g., Bluetooth.

## 2. IP Addressing
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)
- **Private IPs**: Used internally (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)
- **Public IPs**: Routable on the Internet

## 3. MAC Address
- A unique identifier for each network interface card (NIC)
- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- Used in LAN communication and by ARP to map IP addresses to devices

## 4. Subnetting
- Divides a network into smaller segments
- Helps manage traffic and improves security
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` = 256 addresses

## 5. Common Networking Devices
- **Router**: Forwards packets between networks
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN
- **Hub**: Basic device that forwards data to all ports
- **Firewall**: Controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules

## 6. OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Physical** – cables, signals  
2. **Data Link** – MAC addresses, switches  
3. **Network** – IP addresses, routing  
4. **Transport** – TCP/UDP, ports  
5. **Session** – manages sessions  
6. **Presentation** – data formatting, encryption  
7. **Application** – protocols like HTTP, FTP

## 7. Common Protocols
- **TCP/UDP** – transport protocols  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – web traffic  
- **FTP/SFTP** – file transfer  
- **DNS** – resolves domain names to IPs  
- **ARP** – maps IP to MAC address

## 8. Types of Network Communication
- **Unicast** – one-to-one  
- **Broadcast** – one-to-all in a network  
- **Multicast** – one-to-many (specific group)  

## 9. Network Security Basics
- Always secure routers with strong passwords
- Use encryption (HTTPS, VPN)
- Monitor traffic for anomalies
- Segment networks to reduce attack surface

**Summary:**  
Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity. By understanding how devices communicate, addressing schemes, protocols, and security fundamentals, you can better defend systems and detect potential attacks.
