Windows Fundamentals – Module 5 (My Notes)
What Windows Actually Is

Windows is a graphical operating system used on most personal computers. Unlike Linux (which is mostly terminal-based), Windows relies heavily on the GUI, but it still has powerful command-line tools like Command Prompt and PowerShell.

This module helped me understand the basics of how Windows stores files, how settings work, user management, and some important tools.

Windows File System Basics

Windows mainly uses NTFS (New Technology File System).
Some important folders:

C:\Windows → system files

C:\Users → all user profiles

C:\Program Files → installed software

C:\Program Files (x86) → 32-bit apps

C:\Temp → temporary files

C:\Users\<username>\Documents → my documents

C:\Users\<username>\AppData → hidden configs for programs

There are three types of AppData:

Local → machine-based data

LocalLow → low integrity apps

Roaming → follows the user profile

Windows Settings vs Control Panel

Windows now has Settings and the old Control Panel.

Settings app:

Modern interface

For everyday things like display, networking, accounts, updates

Control Panel:

The older interface

Has detailed configuration options

Useful areas:

User Accounts

Network and Internet

Programs and Features (uninstall apps)

Task Manager

Task Manager is used for looking at:

Running apps

Background processes

Startup programs

Users

Services

Shortcut:

Ctrl + Shift + Esc


Or:

Ctrl + Alt + Delete → Task Manager

User Accounts in Windows

Windows has different types of users:

Administrator → full control

Standard User → limited rights

Guest (disabled by default)

Account settings are found at:

Settings → Accounts


You can also manage users via:

Control Panel → User Accounts

File Explorer

This is how you browse files.

Some useful things:

Quick Access for recent files

This PC shows all drives

Right-click → Properties = file details

Useful shortcuts:

Win + E → open File Explorer

Alt + ↑ → go up a folder

Windows Command Line Tools
Command Prompt (cmd)

Basic commands:

dir          (list files)
cd           (change directory)
copy         (copy file)
move         (move file)
del          (delete file)

PowerShell

More advanced and more powerful.

Examples:

Get-ChildItem     (same as dir)
Get-Process
Stop-Process
Get-Service
