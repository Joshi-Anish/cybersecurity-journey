Linux Fundamentals – Module 4 (My Notes)
What Linux Actually Is

Linux is an operating system just like Windows, but it’s open-source and mostly used through the terminal. It’s built on the idea that everything is a file. Most servers run Linux because it’s stable, fast and secure.

I mainly interact with Linux using the shell (bash).

Basic File System Layout

Some important folders I learned:

/home → where user files go

/etc → configuration files

/var → logs, updates, changing files

/bin → basic commands (ls, cp, mv, etc)

/usr → installed programs

/tmp → temporary files

/root → root user’s home folder

Navigating Around (Commands)

Some basic commands I used a lot:

pwd → show where I am

ls → list files

cd foldername → move into a folder

cd .. → go back

cd / → go to root directory

cd ~ → go to home folder

List with extra info:

ls -l


Show hidden files:

ls -a

Working With Files & Directories

Create a directory:

mkdir folder


Create an empty file:

touch file.txt


Move/rename:

mv oldname newname


Copy:

cp file1 file2


Remove:

rm file
rm -r folder


Be careful with rm -r (deletes everything inside).

Viewing File Content

Some commands to read files:

cat file.txt → prints whole file

less file.txt → scroll through file

head file.txt → first 10 lines

tail file.txt → last 10 lines

Using pipe:

cat file.txt | grep "keyword"


(Shows only lines containing the keyword)

Editing Files (Nano)

Nano is a simple terminal editor.

Open file:

nano file.txt


Inside nano:

Ctrl + O = save

Ctrl + X = exit

Ctrl + K = cut

Ctrl + U = paste

Users & Permissions

Linux uses users, groups, and permissions to control access.

To see file permissions:

ls -l


Example:

-rwxr-x--


Breakdown:

first letter: file type

next 3: owner

next 3: group

last 3: others

Changing permissions:

chmod 755 file


Changing ownership:

chown user:group file

Sudo (Root Permissions)

sudo lets me run commands as the root user.

Example:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3


Root user can do anything, so be careful.

Package Management (Debian/Ubuntu)

Linux installs apps via the package manager:

Update list:

sudo apt update


Upgrade installed packages:

sudo apt upgrade


Install something:

sudo apt install package


Remove:

sudo apt remove package

Processes & System Info

Check running processes:

ps aux


Kill a process:

kill PID


System info:

uname -a
hostname
df -h  (disk usage)
free -h (RAM usage)

Networking Commands

Show IP:

ip a


Check connection:

ping google.com


Open ports:

ss -tulnp

Using Wildcards

* = anything
? = single character

Examples:

rm *.txt
ls project?.py

Finding Files & Searching Inside Files

Search files by name:

find / -name filename.txt 2>/dev/null


Search text inside files:

grep "password" file.txt


Recursive search:

grep -R "keyword" .

Getting Help

Helpful commands:

man ls
man grep


Or:

ls --help
