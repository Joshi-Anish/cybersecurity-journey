How the Web Works – Module 3 (My Notes)

What the web actually is:
It’s basically a huge collection of websites, files and services connected through the internet. Everything works using a client and a server. The client is usually my browser, and the server is where the website is hosted.

Client–Server Model

The client (browser) sends a request.

The server receives it, processes it, and sends something back (HTML, JSON, images, etc).

Typical steps:

I type a URL

Browser sends an HTTP request

Server responds

Browser shows the page

URL Breakdown

Example:

https://example.com/products?id=10#reviews


https → protocol

example.com → domain

/products → path

id=10 → query

#reviews → just a page section (not sent to server)

DNS (How domain → IP happens)

When I enter a website:

Browser checks if it already knows the IP

OS cache

My ISP DNS

Root servers

TLD servers (.com, .net)

Authoritative DNS
Then it gets the IP address and loads the site.

Common DNS records:

A = IPv4

AAAA = IPv6

CNAME = alias

MX = mail servers

TXT = text info (SPF, etc.)

HTTP Basics

HTTP = how clients and servers talk.

Two versions:

HTTP (not encrypted)

HTTPS (encrypted with TLS)

A request has:

method

path

headers

(maybe) body

A response has:

status code

headers

body (HTML, JSON, etc.)

Common HTTP Methods

GET → get something

POST → send data

PUT → update

DELETE → delete

HEAD → only headers

OPTIONS → what methods are allowed

HTTP Status Codes (Important ones)

2xx: success

200 OK

201 Created

3xx: redirection

301 moved

302 temporary redirect

4xx: client mistakes

400 bad request

401 unauthorized

403 forbidden

404 not found

5xx: server mistakes

500 server error

503 unavailable

Cookies, Sessions, Local Storage

Cookies: small data saved in browser (logins, preferences).

Sessions: stored on the server, cookie just holds a session ID.

Local storage: more space, stays until cleared manually.

Web Servers

Some examples: Apache, Nginx, IIS.
Their job is to handle requests and return the correct files/data.

How Browsers Render a Page

Download HTML

Download CSS

Download JS

Make the DOM

Make CSSOM

Run JS

Show the final webpage

APIs and JSON

Websites often use APIs to get data.
JSON example:

{
  "user": "anish",
  "role": "student"
}

Basic Web Security Concepts (Beginning)

HTTPS → encryption

XSS → injecting JS into a site

CSRF → tricking a user into doing something

SQL Injection → messing with database queries

CORS → who is allowed to access what
